Question 0.1. What is the meaning of the horizontal and vertical position of the nodes? Give examples of datasets particularly well suited to organize data this way.

The example contains the option to change the layout and graphical properties encoded (in this case, either 'Color' or 'Size'). Use your mouse to click on those options and observe the change.

Question 0.2. Which other channels (visual variables), beside color, size and position, could have been used? Name five.

Question 0.3. Are all the previously mentioned visual variables independent (e.g. if you change one, will it impact others?)? Give examples of graphical properties that are dependent (if any) and independent (if any) from each others.

Question 1.1. Discuss the pros and cons of the two types of rankings (either by relative or absolute position between nodes).

Question 1.2. Which data type (quantitative, ordinal, ..) is best displayed with scatterplots? Which one is not? Give examples.

Question 2.1. What are the pros and cons of using a D3 layout? For example, why would we use the D3 pie layout when we could use a simple circle for layouting?

Question 3.1. Which other strategies can you think of to reduce the visual complexity? One example is edge bundling which we introduce in the following section. Enumerate up to three other strategies.
