# Homework 2 Answers
### 0.1 What is the meaning of the horizontal and vertical position of the nodes? Give examples of datasets particularly well suited to organize data this way.
The horizontal and vertical position don't encode anything on their own. Rather, the position of the nodes to each other on the 2D plane visualizes the relatedness of the data. You could use a force-directed graph to visualize, say, the co-occurence of characters in _Les Mis√©rables_ or the co-occurence of countries' exports.

### Question 0.2. Which other channels (visual variables), beside color, size and position, could have been used? Name five.
You could use:
* Shape
* Luminance
* Saturation
* Angle
* Motion

### 0.3 Are all the previously mentioned visual variables independent (e.g. if you change one, will it impact others?)? Give examples of graphical properties that are dependent (if any) and independent (if any) from each others.
Color is independent, though there could be perceptual differences based on proximity to other colors. While hue, saturation and depth are individual channels, changing one can drastically change the perception of the others (i.e., a completely desaturated set of nodes that was hued categorically). If the marks are non-overlapping, size and position could be dependent, as larger marks would displace the other nodes and distort their position. Most channel pairs are independent. Changing a mark's length won't alter its saturation, for instance.

### 1.1 Discuss the pros and cons of the two types of rankings (either by relative or absolute position between nodes).
Ordinal rankings can be useful when the user is comparing marks that are encoded by an unfamiliar, derived dimension (say, a quality of life index) where the actual value doesn't have any context outside of itself. It's also useful when the ranking has some sort of importance, such as in team rankings for playoff spots. Also, if a few outliers would distort the data and you don't have to worry about the audience not knowing about the magnitude of those outliers, relative rankings can be a quick way to get everything on the same plot. Absolute positioning makes more sense when emphasizing the untransformed magnitude of the values is paramount (say, showing just how many more people China has than most other countries).

### 1.2 Which data type (quantitative, ordinal, ..) is best displayed with scatterplots? Which one is not? Give examples.
It makes more sense to display quantitative data on a scatterplot than ordinal data. Population vs. GDP is a good example for why that's the case. By using quantitative scales, the user can see that almost all nations have small populations and small GDPs relative to the U.S., China and India. On an ordinal scale, you'd gain a bit of readability in spacing that bottom-left cluster out in rankings, but the visualization would be much further from reflecting the data and reality of living in those countries. The U.S. appears to have almost double the GDP of China, for instance, but an ordinal scale would show them next to each other.

### 2.1 What are the pros and cons of using a D3 layout? For example, why would we use the D3 pie layout when we could use a simple circle for layouting?
D3 layouts take care of complicated math that we humans might otherwise mess up. The pie layout, for instance, translates values into radians, which might otherwise put off the beginner graphics editor who just wants a simple pie chart. The force layout is powerful in its ability to provide a rudimentary particle/physics model. In short, it's the closest D3 gets to out-of-the-box graph classes, stopping short enough to provide extensibility for adventurous users (like us).

### 3.1 Which other strategies can you think of to reduce the visual complexity? One example is edge bundling which we introduce in the following section. Enumerate up to three other strategies.
